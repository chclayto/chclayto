Hello all, this my official space for scientific related business (second to LinkedIn). I hope this answers many of the most frequently asked questions that will make future business a little less strangerlike. 

### About me

I have metriculated the status of being a student at the very fine institution of California Polytechnics State University (San Luis Obispo), through hard work and dedication. I graduated early from high school at the age of 16, received multiple AA degrees by age of 20 and I am slated to earn my bachelor's degree by 2024. I have taken on many endevors that have offset my earning off my bachelor's degree in Chemistry, things that fall outside of academia. But with my experience and with what I am capable of doing, I would like to remove any doubts of my suitability for an important role in the STEM field. Allow me to explain a little bit about my transgression.


#### Notable acheivements

I have offered tutoring in various different subjects to students and have run chapters related to political organizations. Since 2019, I have become the CEO and president of the <a href="http://www.santamariaoliveco.com">Santa Maria Olive Co</a>. I make agriculatural and marketing decisions for the company, and oversee financial information and manage certifications related to the company. I also have experience in interning for a very prominent lawfirm in Santa Maria: <a href="http://www.wedefend.net">Michael B. Clayton and Associates</a>. Perhaps I would like to dabble in a profession which deals in medicine and laws governing it. As far as my skills in labratory experience goes, I have worked in the organic chemistry labs since my entrance into Cal Poly and have delevoped much of my modern discipline and ethic for work related to it from this.
